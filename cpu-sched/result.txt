1. Compute the response time and turnaround time when running three jobs of length 200 with the SJF and FIFO schedulers.
        R       T       W
SJF     200     400     200
FIFO    200     400     200

2. Now do the same but with jobs of different lengths: 100, 200, and 300.
SJF
        R       T       W
1       0       100     0
2       100     300     100
3       300     600     300
Avg     133     333     133

FIFO: the same

3. Now do the same, but also with the RR scheduler and a time-slice of 1.
RR
        R       T           W
1       0       300-2       200-2
2       1       500-1       300-1
3       2       600         300
Avg     1       466         266

1: Finish time = 298, execution time = 100 -> wait time = 298 - 100 = 198
2. Finish time = 499, execution time = 200 -> wait time = 499 - 200 = 299
3. Finish time = 600, execution time = 300 -> wait time = 600 - 300 = 300


4. For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
    a. When the length of jobs are in order (from shortest to longest)
    b. Only one job
    c. All jobs have the same length


5. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver the same response times as RR?
All workload lengths are smaller than or equal to the quantum length of SJF.
Additionally, the jobs arrive in order from the shortest length to the longest length.


6. What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
Increase in linear relationship.

7. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase?
   Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
Assume quantum lengths = q.
(N - 1) * q
